# Multithreaded Linux Application Using POSIX Threads and Mutexes

**Operating Systems and Systems Programming Project**

A practical Linux application demonstrating multithreading, concurrent execution, synchronization, critical sections, race conditions, and mutual exclusion using POSIX Threads and mutexes.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Multithreaded Linux Application** using the **C programming language** and **POSIX Threads (pthreads)**.

The application creates multiple threads that perform tasks concurrently. Some threads access a common shared resource, creating a critical section that requires synchronization.

To prevent multiple threads from accessing the shared resource simultaneously, **POSIX mutex locks** are used. A thread acquires the mutex before entering the critical section and releases it after completing the required operation.

The project demonstrates important Operating System concepts including:

* POSIX Threads
* Multithreading
* Concurrent execution
* Mutex synchronization
* Mutual exclusion
* Critical sections
* Race conditions
* Shared resources
* Thread creation
* Thread joining
* Thread termination
* Linux programming

---

# 🎯 Problem Statement

In a multithreaded application, multiple threads may access and modify a shared resource at the same time.

Without proper synchronization, simultaneous access can cause:

* Race conditions
* Data inconsistency
* Unexpected program output
* Incorrect shared-resource values
* Unpredictable program behavior

The objective of this project is to design a Linux-based application where multiple threads can execute concurrently while safely accessing shared resources.

The project uses **POSIX threads** for concurrent execution and **mutexes** for mutual exclusion and synchronization.

---

# ⚙️ Working Principle

## 1. Application Initialization

The application starts by initializing the required shared resource and synchronization mechanism.

A POSIX mutex is initialized before the worker threads begin accessing the shared resource.

---

## 2. Thread Creation

Multiple threads are created using the POSIX Threads API.

The following function is used:

```c
pthread_create()
```

Each thread receives a specific task and executes independently.

The threads can execute concurrently depending on the Linux scheduler.

---

## 3. Concurrent Execution

After creation, multiple threads execute their assigned operations concurrently.

```text
             Main Thread
                  │
          Create Threads
                  │
       ┌──────────┼──────────┐
       ▼          ▼          ▼
   Thread 1   Thread 2   Thread 3
       │          │          │
       ▼          ▼          ▼
     Task       Task       Task
```

Concurrent execution allows multiple threads to make progress during the same period.

---

## 4. Shared Resource

Some operations performed by the threads involve accessing a common shared resource.

For example:

```text
Thread 1 ──────┐
               │
Thread 2 ──────┼──► Shared Resource
               │
Thread 3 ──────┘
```

Since multiple threads may access the resource, synchronization is required.

---

## 5. Critical Section

The portion of the program where the shared resource is accessed or modified is called the **critical section**.

Only one thread should access the protected critical section at a time.

```text
Thread
   │
   ▼
Acquire Mutex
   │
   ▼
Critical Section
   │
   ▼
Access Shared Resource
   │
   ▼
Release Mutex
```

---

## 6. Mutex Synchronization

A mutex provides **mutual exclusion**.

Before entering the critical section, the thread locks the mutex:

```c
pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
```

The thread then performs the operation on the shared resource.

After completing the operation, the mutex is released:

```c
pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
```

This ensures that another thread can access the protected resource only after the current thread has finished.

---

## 7. Race Condition

A race condition can occur when multiple threads access or modify shared data at the same time without synchronization.

### Without Mutex

```text
Thread 1 ───────► Shared Data
                     ▲
                     │
Thread 2 ───────► Shared Data

        ↓

   Race Condition
        ↓
Inconsistent Result
```

### With Mutex

```text
Thread 1 ──► LOCK ──► Critical Section ──► UNLOCK
                                           │
Thread 2 ──────────────────────────────────►
                       waits
```

The mutex prevents simultaneous access to the protected critical section.

---

## 8. Thread Completion

After the threads complete their execution, the main thread waits for them using:

```c
pthread_join()
```

This ensures that the main program does not terminate before the created threads finish their execution.

---

## 9. Mutex Destruction

After all threads have completed and the mutex is no longer required, it is destroyed using:

```c
pthread_mutex_destroy()
```

This releases the resources associated with the mutex.

                Thread Created

# 💻 Basic Mutex Implementation

A simplified implementation of the synchronization mechanism is:

```c
pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);

/* Critical Section */
/* Access or modify shared resource */

pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
```

The mutex ensures that only one thread can execute the protected section at a time.

---

# 🧠 Key Operating System Concepts

## POSIX Threads

POSIX Threads, commonly called **pthreads**, provide an API for creating and managing threads in Linux.

---

## Multithreading

Multithreading allows multiple threads within the same application to execute concurrently.

---

## Concurrency

Concurrency allows multiple threads to make progress during the same period of execution.

---

## Mutex

A mutex is a synchronization mechanism used to provide mutual exclusion when multiple threads access shared resources.

---

## Critical Section

A critical section is a portion of code where shared data or resources are accessed or modified.

---

## Race Condition

A race condition occurs when the result of a program depends on the timing or order in which multiple threads access shared data.

---

## Mutual Exclusion

Mutual exclusion ensures that only one thread accesses a protected critical section at a time.

---

## Thread Joining

`pthread_join()` allows the main thread to wait until a created thread finishes execution.

---

# 🧪 Testing

The application can be tested by observing the execution of multiple threads and the access to the shared resource.

Testing focuses on:

* Multiple thread creation
* Concurrent execution
* Shared-resource access
* Mutex locking
* Mutex unlocking
* Critical-section protection
* Race-condition prevention
* Thread completion
* Final consistent output

---

# 📊 Expected Behavior

When synchronization is correctly implemented:

```text
Thread 1 → Lock → Access Shared Resource → Unlock
                                              │
Thread 2 → Wait ─────────────────────────────┘
                                              │
                                              ▼
                              Thread 2 → Lock → Access
```

Only one thread enters the protected critical section at a time.

This helps maintain consistent shared data.

---

# 🖥️ Compilation

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd ~/path/to/Multithreaded_Linux_Application
```

Compile the C program using GCC:

```bash
gcc main.c -o app -pthread
```

The `-pthread` option enables POSIX thread support.

---

# ▶️ Running the Application

Run the compiled application using:

```bash
./app
```

The program creates multiple threads and executes the assigned tasks concurrently.

---

# 📌 Sample Output

The exact output depends on the implementation and thread scheduling.

A typical execution may look like:

```text
Multithreaded Linux Application

Thread 1 created
Thread 2 created
Thread 3 created

Thread 1 accessing shared resource
Thread 1 completed critical section

Thread 2 accessing shared resource
Thread 2 completed critical section

Thread 3 accessing shared resource
Thread 3 completed critical section

All threads completed successfully.
Final shared resource value: <value>
```

> Thread execution order may change between different runs because thread scheduling is handled by the Linux operating system.
